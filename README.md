# Forkify

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application built using MVC architecture and modern JavaScript tools such as Parcel, Babel, npm, etc. It interacts with the food2fork API to fetch recipe food data, so cooking hobbyists can search and save their favorite recipes.

This project was design by Jonas Schmedtmann for 'The Complete JavaScript Course' on Udemy. Coded & modified by Leo Cao.

The app is deployed and available to use -Â https://forkify-leo.netlify.app/
